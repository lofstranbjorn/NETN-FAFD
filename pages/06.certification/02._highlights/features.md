# Why NETN?

## **Smart** Training - **Connected** Enterprise

Efficient and effective use of NATO and national Modelling & Simulation (M&S) capabilities, to support training, requires standards for connecting and integrating M&S components across the training system enterprise. 

NETN FAFD is a NATO standard recommendation (STANREC 4800) how to represent shared data in distributed simulation environments where M&S services (federates) are connected and federated using the NATO mandated High-Level Architecture standard (STANAG 4603).
