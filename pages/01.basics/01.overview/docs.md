The NATO Education and Training Network (NETN) Federation Architecture and FOM Design (FAFD)
document is a reference document intended to provide architecture and design guidance for developing
distributed simulation and training systems. 

Current version of the NETN FAFD is published by NATO as STANREC 4800 and is publically available. 

In this documentation the main focus is use of the NETN FAFD when designing, implementing and executing distributed 
federated simulations using the IEEE 1516 **High-Level Architecture** (HLA) as the core technical interoperability standard and the NETN 
FAFD **Federation Object Model** (FOM) Modules as the associated information exchange object model. 

For details on HLA we recommend the following free [HLA Tutorial](http://www.pitchtechnologies.com/hlatutorial/).
