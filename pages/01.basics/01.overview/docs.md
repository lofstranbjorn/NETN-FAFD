The NATO Education and Training Network (NETN) Federation Architecture and FOM Design (FAFD)
document is a reference document intended to provide architecture and design guidance for developing
distributed simulation and training systems in the context of Computer Assisted Exercises (CAX). The
guidance provided by the FAFD has been developed to support the NETN vision and is applicable to
NATO CAX, national CAX and to some extent to distributed modelling and simulation in general.

The FAFD focuses mainly on technical interoperability issues in distributed simulation. It is not a
complete guide on how to design a distributed simulation to support CAX but will provide key
architecture and design patterns and proposed solutions. The FAFD provides architecture and design
guidelines on network infrastructure, simulation infrastructure, simulation data exchange models (SDEM)
and how to design a robust, scalable, interoperable and high performing federation of distributed
simulation to support CAX. The document also addresses domain specific requirements of modelling
aspects of units, platforms, activities and other events. Areas specifically included in this version of the
NETN FAFD are CBRN, Logistics, and NETN compatibility with RPR-FOM and German Maritime
FOM (GMF).

Key recommendations include:
* Use of NATO STANAG 4603 (High Level Architecture)
* Use of NATO NETN FOM and associated standard and NATO NETN developed FOM Modules
* Use of RPR-FOM v2.0 (Modularized) and German Maritime FOM (GMF)
* Use of Transfer of Modelling Responsibilities Design Pattern
* Use of MSDL to support Initialization
* Use of C-BML to support Simulation-to-C2 interoperability
* Use of Multi-Resolution Modelling
