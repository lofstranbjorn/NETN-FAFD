The NETN FOM is a defined set of HLA FOM Modules and is a combination of standard modules, modules defined as part of related standards and NETN specific modules.

In any NETN based HLA federation one or more of the NETN FOM modules can be used. Each FOM Module represent types of objects and events 
(interactions) that are used to exchange information between Federates (federated systems). Federates in an NETN federation publish and 
subscribe to the classes defined in the NETN FOM Modules and use HLA services to send and receive updates of class attributes and 
interaction parameters. Individual NETN FOM Modules can be extended and included as part of other FOMs.
