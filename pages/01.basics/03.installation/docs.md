A Federation Agreement is a specification of how FOM Modules and HLA services should be used to support a distributed simulation. 
This documentation specifies best practices and federation agreements for typical NETN FAFD based federations in support of Staff Training 
Computer Assisted Exercises (CAX). 

## Conceptual Model

The basis for any federation design is a conceptual model describing what needs to be represented in the synthetic environment and the 
relationship between these concepts. Based on the conceptual model and the overall federation requirements, an allocation of modelling 
responsibilities is made as part of the federation design. The result is a clear understanding of the interfaces and information exchange required to model the synthetic environment and to maintain a representation of all relationships in a scenario based on the conceptual model.
