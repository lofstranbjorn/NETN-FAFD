Distributed simulation and training exercises are growing in importance within the NATO community as the
requirement to respond rapidly to changing world events means that rapid and flexible multinational forces
are needed for a variety of purposes, ranging from peace-keeping and emergency relief through to
preparation for contingent military operations.
Previous distributed simulation exercises have shown that there is a requirement within NATO for a single
environmental dataset to be used for these exercises, as the creation and correlation of synthetic
environments is both expensive and time consuming.
STO Task Group MSG-071 ‘Missionland’ was set up in 2008 to investigate the requirements and produce a
non-geospecific (generic) environmental dataset for use in distributed multi-national simulation and training
exercises within NATO and NATO PfP countries.
The scope of the group was to provide a static, sensor-capable, environmental representation of a substantial
geographical area containing different geologies and climate and feature types to enable use within a wide
range of simulation systems.
The eight-Nation Task Group worked for four years using a mixture of innovative and established
technologies to produce a coherent and consistent dataset consisting of four million square kilometres of
terrain (the size of Western Europe) set in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean. The group overcame
significant technical problems, as well as solving non-technical issues regarding intellectual property rights,
the re-use of data, and capability process to add new data in order to improve functionality.
The result of the Task Group’s activities includes much more than just this report. It also includes tangible
items such as the dataset and associated software tools, as well as conditions of use and a contribution guide
that will allow future additions.
While the Task Group’s activities were successful in generating the Missionland dataset, it should be
stressed that the technical work involved risk and innovation, which caused delay. This meant that not all of
the original objectives were achieved within the time available. However, the work undertaken has reduced
risks, and a clear development path exists to achieve remaining objectives.
The Missionland data set can be used as it is now; however, for maximum benefit, further work should be
undertaken to ensure that the data is safely stored and distributed, tools are maintained, users of the dataset
are adequately supported, and specific improvements for exercises using Missionland can be easily added.
As a result of the Task Group activities, a number of recommendations are provided in this report, with the
three most important ones listed below:
• The setting up of the Missionland Data Authority (MLDA) to manage and distribute the data set
in the future and to handle any contributions.
