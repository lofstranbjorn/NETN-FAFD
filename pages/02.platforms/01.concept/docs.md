Physical Entities are objects in the synthetic environment that models real-world physical objects. Each entity has a set of attributes that characterizes the object and defines its ground-truth state.

The NETN FOM specifies a **NETN_PhysicalEntity** FOM module to define extensions to the corresponding **RPR2-PhysicalEntity** FOM module object classes.

Common to all Physical Entities is a set of base attributes defining the object spatial state and entity type according to the RPR-FOM standard and associated EntityType enumeration standard.
